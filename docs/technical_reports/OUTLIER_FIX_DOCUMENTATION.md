# 🛠️ BudgetWise AI - Outlier Fix Documentation

## 🚨 Problem Identified

Your BudgetWise AI application was showing **extreme outlier values**:

- **Max Daily Expense**: $1,095,774,797.50 (Over 1 billion dollars!)
- **Mean Daily Expense**: $788,124.54 (Nearly $800k per day)
- **Root Cause**: Extreme outliers in the original dataset that weren't properly handled during preprocessing

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### **1. Advanced Outlier Cleaning**
- ✅ **Created `scripts/outlier_cleaner.py`**: Advanced outlier detection and cleaning system
- ✅ **Aggressive Capping**: Set realistic limits per expense category:
  - Bills & Utilities: $1,000/day max
  - Food & Dining: $300/day max  
  - Entertainment: $500/day max
  - Healthcare: $2,000/day max
  - Travel: $2,000/day max
  - Others: $1,000/day max
  - Education: $2,000/day max
  - Savings: $10,000/day max
  - Income: $50,000/day max

### **2. Data Quality Improvement**
**Before Cleaning:**
```
Original Records: 2,137
Max Daily Expense: $1,095,774,797.50
Mean Daily Expense: $788,124.54
```

**After Cleaning:**
```
Final Records: 1,092 (51% retention)
Max Daily Expense: $3,000.00
Mean Daily Expense: $1,705.53
Median Daily Expense: $1,500.00
```

### **3. Files Generated**
- ✅ `data/processed/train_data_cleaned.csv`
- ✅ `data/processed/val_data_cleaned.csv`
- ✅ `data/processed/test_data_cleaned.csv`
- ✅ `data/processed/all_data_cleaned.csv`

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

### **Local Fix (Completed)**
```bash
# 1. Run the outlier cleaner
python scripts/outlier_cleaner.py

# 2. Apply the data patch
cd app
python patch_data.py

# 3. Test locally
streamlit run budgetwise_app.py
```

### **Cloud Deployment Fix**

#### **Option 1: Update Streamlit Cloud (Recommended)**
1. **Commit cleaned data to repository**:
   ```bash
   # Add cleaned data to git
   git add data/processed/train_data.csv
   git add data/processed/val_data.csv  
   git add data/processed/test_data.csv
   git commit -m "Fix: Replace outlier data with cleaned realistic values"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Streamlit Cloud will automatically redeploy** with fixed data

#### **Option 2: Include Sample Data (Already Done)**
- ✅ `sample_expense_data.csv` already in repository root
- ✅ App fallback logic already implemented
- ✅ Streamlit Cloud will use sample data if main data unavailable

## 📊 Expected Results After Fix

### **Dashboard Metrics**
- **Max Daily Expense**: ~$3,000 (reasonable)
- **Mean Daily Expense**: ~$1,700 (realistic)  
- **Data Range**: Maintained historical coverage
- **Total Records**: ~1,100 (outliers removed)

### **Visualization Improvements**
- ✅ **Realistic Charts**: No more billion-dollar spikes
- ✅ **Proper Scaling**: Charts show meaningful trends
- ✅ **Accurate Insights**: AI recommendations based on real data
- ✅ **Better UX**: Users see believable expense patterns

## 🎯 Verification Steps

### **Local Verification**
```bash
# Quick verification script
cd app
python test_data_loading.py

# Expected output:
# ✅ Cleaned train data loaded successfully
# Shape: (764, 11)
# Total daily expense stats:
#   Min: $150.00
#   Max: $3000.00
#   Mean: $1677.49
#   Median: $1500.00
```

### **Cloud Verification**
1. Visit: https://budgetwise-ai-based-expense-forecasting-tool.streamlit.app/
2. Check dashboard metrics:
   - Max Daily Expense should be ≤ $3,000
   - Mean Daily Expense should be ~$1,500-2,000
   - Charts should show realistic patterns
