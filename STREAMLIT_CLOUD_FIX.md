# 🚀 Streamlit Cloud Deployment Guide

## Quick Fix for "Data files not found" Error

The error occurs because Streamlit Cloud doesn't have access to your local data files. Here are the solutions:

### ✅ Solution 1: Use the Updated Application (Recommended)

The application has been updated to handle missing data files gracefully:

1. **Commit and push the latest changes** to your GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: Add cloud deployment support with fallback data handling"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Redeploy on Streamlit Cloud** - the app will now:
   - ✅ Show a warning about using sample data
   - ✅ Display demo functionality with sample expense data
   - ✅ Work with model comparison using realistic sample results
   - ✅ Allow predictions using mock models

### ✅ Solution 2: Include Data Files in Repository

If you want full functionality with your actual data:

1. **Add processed data to git** (if file sizes are reasonable):
   ```bash
   # Remove data directories from .gitignore temporarily
   git add data/processed/*.csv
   git add models/*/*.csv
   git commit -m "Add processed data and model results for cloud deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Use Git LFS for large files** (if data files are >100MB):
   ```bash
   git lfs install
   git lfs track "*.csv"
   git lfs track "*.pkl"
   git add .gitattributes
   git add data/ models/
   git commit -m "Add data files using Git LFS"
   git push origin main
   ```

### ✅ Solution 3: Environment-Specific Configuration

Create a `config.py` file to detect deployment environment:

```python
import os
import streamlit as st

def is_streamlit_cloud():
    """Detect if running on Streamlit Cloud"""
    return os.getenv('STREAMLIT_SHARING_MODE') or 'HOSTNAME' in os.environ

def get_data_path():
    """Get appropriate data path based on environment"""
    if is_streamlit_cloud():
        return "sample_expense_data.csv"  # Use sample data in cloud
    else:
        return "../data/processed/train_data.csv"  # Use full data locally
```

## 🔧 Current Application Status

The updated `budgetwise_app.py` now includes:

- ✅ **Automatic fallback**: Uses sample data when real data isn't available
- ✅ **Cloud-friendly paths**: Tries multiple path configurations
- ✅ **Demo model results**: Shows realistic sample performance metrics
- ✅ **User-friendly messages**: Clear explanations about limited functionality
- ✅ **Full UI functionality**: All pages work with sample data

## 📋 Files to Commit for Cloud Deployment

Make sure these files are in your repository:

```
Repository Root:
├── streamlit_app.py              # Cloud entry point
├── requirements.txt              # Dependencies  
├── sample_expense_data.csv       # Sample data for demo
├── .streamlit/config.toml        # Streamlit configuration
├── app/
│   └── budgetwise_app.py         # Updated main application
└── README.md                     # Updated documentation
```

## 🌐 Streamlit Cloud Deployment Steps

1. **Push latest changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Streamlit Cloud deployment support"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Streamlit Cloud**:
   - Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Set main file as: `streamlit_app.py` (or `app/budgetwise_app.py`)
   - Click "Deploy"

3. **Verify deployment**:
   - App should load with sample data
   - Warning message about demo mode should appear
   - All functionality should work with limited dataset

## ⚠️ Expected Behavior in Cloud

When deployed to Streamlit Cloud, your app will:

- ✅ **Start successfully** without crashes
- ⚠️ **Show warning** about using sample data  
- ✅ **Display dashboard** with demo expense data
- ✅ **Allow predictions** using mock models
- ✅ **Show model comparison** with realistic sample results
- ℹ️ **Inform users** about full functionality requiring local deployment

## 🔄 For Full Functionality

To get complete functionality in the cloud:

1. **Include your data**: Add `budgetwise_finance_dataset.csv` to repository root
2. **Train models locally**: Run all training scripts and commit model files
3. **Use Git LFS**: For large model files (>100MB)
4. **Verify locally**: Test that `streamlit_app.py` works from repository root

## 🎯 Testing Your Fix

Before deploying, test locally:

```bash
# Test from repository root (simulates cloud environment)
cd C:\Users\moham\Infosys
streamlit run streamlit_app.py

# Should work with sample data and show appropriate warnings
```

Your Streamlit Cloud deployment should now work! 🚀
